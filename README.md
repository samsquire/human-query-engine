HQE is a simple script that asks questions to users. What makes this useful:

* **Virtual friend** Is like a virtual friend that keeps a conversation going.
* **Some thing to do** Answering questions is some thing to do
* **Collect and aggregate data about yourself.** If you're asked about your bank balance, you can track it over days.
* **Simple random questions** can over time add up to insightful questions about yourself.

# Asking questions based on the answers to existing questions

Developers of human queries should be able to layer human questioning ontop of other human questioning. If you answer a certain value, you can be given one set of questions and likewise for another set of answers.
